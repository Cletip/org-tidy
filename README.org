ðŸ§¹ An Emacs minor mode to automatically tidy org-mode property drawers.

* Why?
Org-mode's property drawer is a very useful feature. We can store properties associated with an entry in property drawer. I use org-roam every day. And org-roam node is an entry with ID property. But if I create many nodes in a single file, there will be a lot of property drawers. This is really annoying. Even after they are folded, there are still lines like ~:PROPERTIES: ...~ , which makes the whole buffer hard to read.

At first I googled for some tricks to hide property drawers completely. And I found there are many people like me who are bothered by this problem. Of course there are solutions. But these solutions involve a lot of code. So I made this package.

After org-tidy mode is turned on, these property drawers are hidden. And the symbol â™¯ is appended after the headline. You can also customize how property drawers will be hidden.

* Usage

** Manual
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-tidy)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-tidy-mode)
#+end_src

** How to edit property drawers in org-tidy-mode?
If you need to edit only one drawer temporarily, you can simply ~M-x org-tidy-untidy-buffer~. When you save the buffer, it will be tidied again.

If you need to edit a lot of drawers, you can ~M-x org-tidy-toggle~. Then the buffer will not be tidied on save, until ~M-x org-tidy-toggle~ again.
