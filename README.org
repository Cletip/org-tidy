ðŸ§¹ An Emacs minor mode to automatically tidy org-mode property drawers.

* Why?
Org-mode's property drawer is a very useful feature. We can store properties associated with an entry in property drawer. I use org-roam every day. And org-roam node is an entry with ID property. But if I create many nodes in a single file, there will be a lot of property drawers. This is really annoying. Even after they are folded, there are still lines like ~:PROPERTIES: ...~ , which makes the whole buffer hard to read.

At first I googled for some tricks to hide property drawers completely. And I found there are many people like me who are bothered by this problem. Of course there are solutions. But these solutions involve a lot of code. So I made this package.

After org-tidy mode is turned on, these property drawers are hidden. And the symbol â™¯ is appended after the headline. You can also customize how property drawers will be hidden.
